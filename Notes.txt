sdcs.f90: compareMeanEn
- setting meanSDCS=0 in case where all CS are zero
  might be the wrong approach. Probably better to ensure
  cross sections are never zero? 
Scaling: scaling sdcs cross sections could hide interpolation
         issues. If there seem to be SDCS problems, disable 
         scaling. 


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Units!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
a.u: atomic units, energy measured in Hartees, to convert Hartees 
     to eV, multiply by 2*13.6.



!!!!!!Current work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is an error in the file io for reading in the inelastic dcs
SDCS gives TICS off by 2 orders of magnitude at two energy grid points.
Test: calculate energy loss distribution function L(E) using CS in
      simulations, compare to stopping power paper + older work.
-fix interpolation issues, stopping power is not quite right. Check 
 interpolated totalcs values to make sure they agree with input data files
 e.g. Try totalcs at 50 eV incident energy.
-check that some of the dcs for excitations are in fact negative
-modify the pseudostate symmetrisation to handle the case of a low
 number of pseudostates.


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!TODO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-Fix openMp crashing issue. Crashes when excitatin energies changed to fixed
 nuclei values.  (Needed to make clean and recompile)
-check how SDCS are sampled, perhaps simplify treatment of indistinguishability. (Correct for now, fix how integration is done)
-force incident electron to move along z axis. Check how many electrons are backscattered
 into negative z.
-change excitation energies and CS to be averages over vibrational states.
-calculate uncertainties by varying cross sections values and normalising them.
-investigate mixture distributions.




!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Known issues to fix (systematically) before publication!!!!!!!!
- fix issues with ionisation pseudostate symmetrisation and interpolation for a
  low incident energies. Ensure the pseudostate and SDCS methods give the same
  results following this modification.
- compare(plot), systematically, across a range of incident energies, the excitation,
  ionisation and TICS cross sections of MCCC and Green and Garvey.
- achieve the same values for w as Green and Garvey for the same inputs.
- incorrect values for the stopping power L(E), oscillations in interpolated SDCS 
  for bound excitations.
- same, slight disagreement of interpolated totalcs CS values with input files.
- need to check that the DCS are in fact negative for certain scattering angles
  and are being sampled correctly.
-most important: fix the ordering of pseudostate symmetrisation.

-omp crashing: works fine when using adiabatic nuclei energy values, crashes
 when switching just to fixed nuclei excitatino energies.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!What we know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-including vibrational states explicitly causes three significant changes,
 the number of secondary electron dissociations increases by a factor of 
 seven, the 1/(mean energy per ion pair) increases and the mean number of
 excitations normalised by energy increases significantly also. The issue 
 is that it is invalid to use the df summed over vibrational states
 for each vibrational state. Each electronic and vibrational transition must have
 its own dissociation fraction for the results to be valid/
-IONISATIONS: 
 -> The ejection angle of one e is determined by the other due to 
    momentum conseravtion.
 -> The ejection energy of one e is determined by the other due to 
    energy conservation laws.
 -> Experimentally, it seems like double differential CS should be used 
    for selecting electron energy loss and scattering angle.
 -> Perhaps even triple differential cross sections.
-SCATTERING ANGLE: need to update to use different dcs for different
 transitions. 







!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Checks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-SDCS: plot integrated cross section as a function of 
       incident energy for interpolated SDCS, integrated
       input file values and summed totalcs. -done
-SDCS: plot SDCS at particular incident energies and compare
       with values in input files. -done
-fitted SDCS: produce exponentially decaying fit to pseudostate CS
       and differentiate to get approximate SDCS, agreement/disagreement
       with SDCS should tell use whether or not gibbs' phenomenon is 
       responsible for the difference.  
-scaling SDCS: produce a function that scales/distorts the SDCS over the
       entire energy range, but preserves total ionisation cross section.
       Compare results with regular SDCS to check sensitivity of results
       to SDCS values.  -implemented
-symmetrising totalCS: causes stateNumber selection issues, need to account
       for symmetrisation in ejection energy selection
-plot energy loss as a function of incident energy, plot excitations per 
 ion pair.




!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Known bugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-scaling fitted SDCS: SDCS fit gives zero CS below 17.0 eV, as this is
      the minimum energy for which totalcs are available. This causes
      the scaling routine to divide by zero. Need to adjust SDCS fit
      to handle this low energy case.
-sdcs fit: plot of fitted SDCS produced after fitting all CS in sdcsBasis
      is different in magnitude to that produced by calling the fitting
      function separately, should be the same.




!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Current Approximations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-dissociation fractions: including explicit vibrational levels, but still using 
 dissociation fractions summed over final vibrational states for a particular 
 electronic excitation. Should still give reasonable results. In future will
 want to generate dissociation fractions (from dissociation CS) for individual 
 final vibrational states for a given final electronic state. (pair nf, vf), 
 this should include excitation to dissociative vibrational states. 
-excitations: tcstostate.f90 assumes all excitations are from state (n=0,v=0)




NEED TO UPDATE
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-selectVcsState: need a physically reasonable choice for cross sections sigma
 used to calculate path length when vcs are zero. Currently uses totalcs cross section.
-vibrational cross sections: proper use requires vibrational excitation CS for 
 each electronic state selected. Currently only use a select few electronic states.

-vibrational cross sections: (today's work): read in vibrational cross sections for 
 all available electronic states. From given set of 'states' for electronic excitation
 create a new vibrationally resolved set, with modified cs and ein. Modify getcsatein
 to account for this. 
-vibrational resolution: can be multiple states with same electronic label, but different
 ang mom, parity, etc
